## Inspiration
As a crew of purely college-centric developers, we know that laundromats are not
always the most ideal place to do your laundry at 2:00am on a Friday night. In a
large, crowded metropolis, this can at times feel like a nightmare scenario. Now
imagine getting clean laundry in a hospital environment during an ongoing
geopolitical conflict. At Project MARS (i.e. Project #M.RS.) [pronounced in
English like our 4th planet from the sun] , we firmly believe that all people
should have access to clean and secure laundry, no matter where they may be on
the globe. 

## What it does
We plan to release $10-100 open source kits that allows those with sufficient
technical abilities to retrofit existing coin-operated laundry machines and
convert them into "smart" laundry machines that can accept payment through
digital wallet services (ideally Bitcoin/Ethereum and something like Coinbase,
which just had its IPO ðŸ¥³)


## How I/we built it
- Elbow grease 
- Love
- More elbow grease

### Toolchain
- Vim/Neovim
- Spacemacs
- Tmux
- ZSH
- Homebrew
- Autodesk Fusion 360
- Autodesk EAGLE
- Autodesk ReCap

## Challenges we ran into
1. Team assembly
2. Scheduling
3. COVID-19 paranoia

## Accomplishments that we're proud of
At this point, with technical difficulty piling upon technical difficulty with
regards to our payment platforms (we're all rather young, and thus inexperienced
as financiers) we are highly grateful to have any code base up and running,
including this markdown file. 

## What we learned
That it takes all walks of live to succeed in the modern IT-landscape. The
future, we believe, belongs to hybrid systems, and that includes hybrid people.

## What's next for Project #M.RS.
- Legal incorporation (LLC preferred)
- Domain registration
- Reconciling AWS expenses

## Other members
Unfortunately, we were unable to recruit any other members through the official
University of Iowa sponsored website, primarily due to an inordinate number of
scheduling conflicts that arose during the current semester. We, unlike the
University of Iowa Board of Regents (who denied all students even
basic/alternative spring break), firmly believe in giving students the right to
choose.

## Inclusivity statement
We at Project #M.RS. firmly believe that racism and other violent prejudices
have no place in the work environment. I (Michael Pass) just got done with an
internship in Silicon Valley and am relieved to report that it was fully
demonstrated to me that in Silicon Valley, the quality of one's ideas are
generally valued over the color of one's flesh. At Project #M.RS., we do not
discriminate on the basis of gender, age, sex, sexual orientation, or any other
class-protected status as currently defined under Iowa law.
