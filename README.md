## Inspiration
As a crew of purely college-centric developers, we know that laundromats are not
always the most ideal place to do your laundry at 2:00am on a Friday night. In a
large, crowded metropolis, this can at times feel like a nightmare scenario. Now
imagine getting clean laundry in a hospital environment during an ongoing
geopolitical conflict. At Project MARS (Project #M.RS.), we firmly believe that
all people should have access to clean and secure laundry, no matter where they
may be on the globe.

## Other members
Unfortunately, we were unable to recruit any other members through the official
University of Iowa sponsored website, primarily due to an inordinate number of
scheduling conflicts that arose during the current semester. We, unlike the
University of Iowa Board of Regents (who denied all students even
basic/alternative spring break), firmly believe in giving students the right to
choose.

## Inclusivity statement
We at Project #M.RS. firmly believe that racism and other violent prejudices
have no place in the work environment. I (Michael Pass) just got done with an
internship in Silicon Valley and am relieved to report that it was fully
demonstrated to me that in Silicon Valley, the quality of one's ideas are
generally valued over the color of one's flesh. At Project #M.RS., we do not
discriminate on the basis of gender, age, sex, sexual orientation, or any other
class-protected status as currently defined under Iowa law.
